Mean images are computed by:
1. Reslicing and resizing images to have the same number of voxels and voxel size.
2. For each exemplar image, the standard deviation of nonzero component loadings is calculated. 
3. For each exemplar image, component loadings in each voxel are divided by the standard deviation. This is to compensate for some of the variation in the spread of loadings in different exemplars.
4. To compute the value of each voxel in the mean image, the mean of all nonzero component loadings from all exemplar images for a certain voxel is computed and stored as the new loading value. Only nonzero loadings are used in means so that average loadings are not decreased by networks obtained with masks that did not encompass the entire brain.


Note: Because component loadings are divided by their small standard deviation, this amplifies the loadings in the mean image. Therefore use larger loadings when viewing images.
